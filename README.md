THIS IS MY PROJECT FOR HACKMAP:-
IT IS A KIND OF SEARCH ENGINE WHERE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ICONS OF WEBSITES ARE GIVEN. THERE IS AN INPUT FIELD IN WHICH THE USER WILL ENTER 
THE TEXT HE WANT TO SEARCH IN THE GIVEN WEBSITES. WHEN THE USER INPUTS THAT , HE /SHE WILL SELECT THE TYPE OF WEBSITE THAT THEY WANT TO SEARCH IN, THE RESULTS WILL BE DISPLAYED IN A NEW TAB.
I HAVE USED JAVASCRIPT, HTML AND CSS IN THIS PROJECT.
